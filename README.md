# LoanDecisionMaking
Preliminary LoanDecisionMaking with financial documents.

## Understanding Your Document Variety
Since you work with multiple clients, each using different accounting software and formats, we'll start by analyzing the range of documents you typically receive. We'll examine how different clients label the same financial items - some might call it "Total Revenue" while others use "Gross Sales" or "Total Income."

## Creating a Smart Translation System
We'll build an intelligent mapping system that recognizes when different terms mean the same thing. The system will learn that "Cash & Cash Equivalents," "Cash on Hand," and "Liquid Assets" all refer to the same balance sheet item, ensuring consistent data extraction regardless of how your clients format their statements.

## Flexible Document Processing
The system will be designed to automatically identify whether you're looking at a Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss statement, or Cash Flow statement. It will then adapt its extraction approach based on the document type and structure, handling both professionally formatted statements and simpler client-generated reports.

## Learning from Your Data
As you process more client documents, the system becomes smarter. When it successfully extracts data from a new client format, it remembers that pattern for future documents from the same client, reducing manual intervention over time.

## Quality Assurance Built-In
The system includes automatic validation - for instance, ensuring Balance Sheets actually balance and flagging any extracted numbers that seem unusual. This gives you confidence in the accuracy of the processed data.

## Easy Customization
For your most frequent clients with unique formats, we can set up custom processing rules without requiring code changes. This means you can fine-tune how the system handles specific client requirements.

## Reliable Error Handling
When the system encounters something it can't process automatically, it will clearly indicate what needs manual review rather than making incorrect assumptions, ensuring data integrity for your financial analysis.
